# Juicebot
An irc bot that can write files to a remote machine.

The base TCP client is functional as well as all aspects beside the writing ability.  I have yet to test it due to lack of secure irc server.

Please use caution when using this client.  Since it has the ability to write files to the host computer, its potential for abuse is high.
